# Secret-Santa-Generator

 This is a Python script that takes a list of Secret Santa participants, assigns each of them a gift receiver, and notifies them through email. The idea of the project came up last Christmas, when multiple organizations I was involved in decided to organize Secret Santa right around finals week. Instead of each group having to meet twice, once for Secret Santa assignment and another for gift exchange, the script streamlined the process so each group only had to meet for gift exchange. In the near future, I plan on turning the script into a web application so that people who are unfamiliar with the command-line interface can use it conveniently with a more user-friendly interface.
